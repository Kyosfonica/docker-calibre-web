**2017-11-04 - v1.1.10**

 * added support for a configuration directory (as asked in ticket #13), 
   where the configuration related files like `app.db` and `gdrive.db` will be stored;
   be aware that `metadata.db` will be still stored at the books directory which is required by the original Calibre application
 * new options `-v <your Calibre Web config folder>:/calibre-web/config` and `-e USE_CONFIG_DIR=true` to setup the configuration directory

**2017-10-30 - v1.1.9**

 * new base image [technosoft2000/alpine-base:3.6-3](https://hub.docker.com/r/technosoft2000/alpine-base/)

```

**2017-09-10 - v1.1.8**

 * added additional check to proof if the `vendor` directory is available and create it if needed;
   this bugfix is needed because the default `vendor` directory was removed from the [janeczku/calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) sources - see https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/commit/b494b6b62af5aaa79d22b3cb80afc5420b6de621
 * due the above bugfix the `kindlegen` symlink works again and is usable at __Calibre Web__

**2017-08-19 - v1.1.7**

 * added python library `unidecode` to required dependencys - see also at [janeczku/calibre-web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) 
   issue [Transliteration of folders and filenames](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/257)
 * added initial Calibre `metadata.db` and `metadata_db_prefs_backup.json` 
   to support the case that the container can be started without an already existing Calibre library - see also at issue #8 __metadata.db__

**2017-07-29 - v1.1.6**

 * fixed issue with ImageMagick and Wand - the error 'You probably had not installed ImageMagick library.' was shown at `calibre-web.log`;
   Alpine 3.6 delivers already ImageMagick 7 which isn't supported by Wand yet, due this ImageMagick 6 has to be compiled from source.
   See also at https://github.com/dahlia/wand/issues/287
 * loading of book metadata works now too because of the ImageMagick fix
 * updated README.MD with information how to detect image version and how to monitor `calibre-web.log`
